#  SelfSizingTextInputAccessoryViewExample

Eonil, 2018 /12/06

Self-sizing text-view on input accessory view can be composited simply but it's hard to figure
out correct configurations. And such compositions extermely hard to encapsulate into a library.

Here I provide simple example which describes how to build such configuration. 
This example project is provided as an illustration rather than a library. You are supposed to
read core source code and copy and paste them into your project where appropriate.

See [`ExampleTextTypingView`](SelfSizingTextInputAccessoryViewExample/ExampleTextTypingView.swift) for core code.
You also execute this project from Simulator directly.
